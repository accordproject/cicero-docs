Introduction 
============

Cicero templates bind legally enforceable natural language text to executable business logic. They
provide the foundational technology for legal professionals to formalise a set of legally
enforceable executable clauses (smart clauses). The templates are designed to be easy and quick to
create from existing legal contracts by legal professionals, and then made executable by
programmers using general purpose programming languages, or legal technologists or programmers
using domain specific languages. Templates may support one or more locales, allowing the template
to be editing or visualized in different languages, whilst preserving a single locale-neutral
executable representation. Executable smart clauses are easy to hash for storage in content-based
addressing systems (out of scope for this specification).

Cicero includes a JavaScript Node.js VM based execution engine to execute instances of templates.
The Javascript engine is designed to be easily embeddable across a wide-variety of form factors:
web, middleware, SaaS, on-blockchain execution and off-blockchain execution. The templates, clauses
and the engine are designed to integrate into a traditional DevOps practices and CI/CD, including
unit and system testing and code coverage analysis.
